# 🌍 Smart Sustainable City – Interactive Prototype

**Live Demo:** 
https://vinanthi07.github.io/Smart_Sustainability/

This repository contains a **fully interactive, front-end prototype** demonstrating cutting-edge solutions for sustainable urban living.  
It focuses on **food management, waste minimisation, and water sustainability**, using **real-time browser features** to simulate smart city operations.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1️⃣ Surplus Food Management
- Donors can **upload food items** with quantity and freshness timer.  
- **Live interactive map** shows donor location using browser geolocation.  
- Freshness timers **auto-update and remove expired items**.  
- Receivers can **view available food items in real time** and “claim” them.  
- Demonstrates **real-time problem-solving for food waste reduction**.

### 2️⃣ Waste Minimisation
- Camera access opens **reliably in-browser** for waste monitoring.  
- Waste type can be **manually selected** (Plastic / Organic / Metal).  
- **Illegal dumping alerts** with geolocation capture.  
- Highlights **smart urban cleanliness solutions** and automated reporting.

### 3️⃣ Water Sustainability
- Users can **register apartments or business locations**.  
- **Rain prediction** simulation shows smart water harvesting.  
- **Smart tank monitoring** linked to registered locations.  
- Demonstrates **efficient use of rainwater and greywater recycling**.
